// Definition of "Peptalk":

// Every syllable of the word is repeated, such that the repetion starts with a "p"
// In the repetition of the syllable, all leading consonants (if any) are replaced by a "p", i.e. cof-fe-e becomes cofpof-fepe-epe
// A syllable is defined as: zero or more consonants followed by a single vowel followed by zero or more consonants. 
// For this assignment, only {aeiou} are considered vowels.
// For this assignment, we will use the following simplified rule for determining where to split a word into syllables:
//  A word is subdivided into syllables in such a way that there is an even split of consonants between adjacent syllables. 
//  In case of an odd number of consonants between vowels, the latter syllable gets an extra consonant.
//   Example, which also highlights the imperfection of the rule:
// assignment
// (a)ss(i)gnm(e)nt
// (a)s-s(i)g-nm(e)nt
// as-sig-nment
// as-pas-sig-pig-nment-pent
// aspassigpignmentpent
// For this assignment you must have a main method that reads the input from stdin and outputs to stdout. The input will be sequence of words.

// Create a class called PepTalk. This class should be able to encode "peptalk".
