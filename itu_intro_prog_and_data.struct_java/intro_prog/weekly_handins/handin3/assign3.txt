This exercise is about modelling a small forest of trees. Each tree has an age, a height, and also a growth rate. You have to do the following:
Create a class Tree
Add the following three private fields to the Tree class:
•	age of type int: the tree's age in years.
•	height of type double: the tree's height in meters.
•	growthPct of type double: the tree's growth per year as a percentage.
Create a constructor for the class Tree(double growthPct), taking a single parameter of type double. The constructor must set the initial height to be 0.25 meters, and the age to be 1 year, and the growth rate to be the parameter given to the constructor.
Create a public toString() method that returns a String with the format: "Tree(age = 1, height = 0.25)", where 1 and 0.25 are substituted with what the value of the corresponding fields are.
Create a public method growOneYear(), which increases the age by one, and increases the height of the tree according to the formula height * (1 + growthPct / 100).
Modify the growOneYear() method such that a tree will stop growing once it reaches a height of 20 meters.
Create a class Forest
Add a private field trees that stores a List of Tree
Create a constructor for the class Forest(). The constructor must initialize the List.
Create a public addTree(int growthPct) that adds a Tree to the List.
Create a public toString() method that returns a String with the format: "Forest(Tree(age = 1, height = 0.25)Tree(age = 1, height = 0.25)Tree(age = 1, height = 0.25))", where the data reflects the actual state of each tree.
Create a growOneYear() method that causes all the trees in the forrest to grow by one year.
