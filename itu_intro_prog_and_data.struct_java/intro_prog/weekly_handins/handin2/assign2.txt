Create a class called Student.
The class has two fields:
•	The name of the student (String name)
•	The age of the student (int age)
and a constructor Student(String name, int age), that initializes the fields to the value of the parameters.
Create two methods String getName() and int getAge() to retrieve the name and age of a student.
Create a String toString method (A textual representation of an object). A student should be represented by the following text: "The name of the student is [name]. The student is [age] years old."
Create two setter methods void setName(String name) and void setAge(int age) to change the name and age for a student.
In the void setAge(int age) it is important to know that the university only admits students between 16 and 99 years old. If the student is too young print "The university does not accept students below 16". If the student is too old print "The university does not accept students that are older than 99". Only set the age, if the age is within the range.
